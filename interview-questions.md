# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a gem?

Your answer: Gem file hold the information about Ruby dependencies. It is like package.json file in react.

Researched answer: Gems in rails are libraries that allow any RUBY on Rails developer to add functionalities without writing code. In essence a gem is a bunch of perfectly packaged ruby code that gives you access to custom methods somebody else wrote. So far we used two types of gem methods - RSspec and ActiveRecord.

2. What does the acronym CRUD stand for?

Your answer: CRUD stands for Create Read Update and Delete. When talking about CRUD, most of time we are talking about basic operations of persistent storage.

Researched answer: In computer programming CRUD is sometimes used used to describe user interface conventions that facilitate viewing, searching, and changing information using computer-based forms and reports. Many software developers see CRUD as more of guidance since CRUD was not made as a modern way to create API.

3. What is Ruby on Rails?

Your answer:Ruby on Rails is a ful stack framework. It comes with many tools for you to build an application quickly. It is very "opinionated" framework, which means, there are many rules you have to follow in order to utilize its abilities. It comes with MVC files structure already in place for you to run with.

Researched answer: Ruby on Rails is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby. It simplifies the creation of web applications. This is done by providing default structure for your code, any database use, and the web pages the application will serve.

4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer:In a relational database every piece of information has a relationship with every other piece of information. This is possible since every data record stored will have a unique identity we can utilize further.

Researched answer: A relational database is a kind of database that stores and gives access to data points related to each other. It is based on the relational model and a precise data representation in tables. Each row in the table is documented with a particular ID called the key in a relational database. Every table in a database has a mandatory field that identifies each record. This type of system is the most widely used database management systems. There are also 4 more typed of DBMS systems: Object-Oriented Database (OOD), Hierarchical Database, Network database, and NoSQL database.

5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: Having each table with a primary key assures row-level accessibility. This allows us to access data in a more structured and predictable manner. Being able to allocate a piece of data using the primary key allows us to use CRUD operations in more efficient manner. Also, there are benefits of being able to use the primary key of one table as a foreign key in another table in effort to create associations between the two and further.

Researched answer: In a relational table the primary uniquely identifies each record in the table. Databases use keys to compare, sort, and store records, and to create relationship between records. Choosing the primary key in a database is one of the most important steps in the process. It allows database operations on the table to be faster because it also serves as an index. The table's data is by default present ordered by the primary key.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: are set of standards used in many languages to create efficient routes. Whet using HTTP methods (GET,POST,PATCH,DELETE) we basically mapping out CRUD actions in a conventional pattern. This makes it easier for other devs to understand and navigate an application and provide consistent URL paths for users.

2. JSON:stand for JavaScript Object Notations. It is a text-based way of representing JavaScript object literals, arrays, and other data. It is relatively easy to read and write. JSON is a language the is commonly used for data storage and transfer.

3. ERB: (or Embedded RuBy) is a feature of Ruby that enables you to conveniently generate any kind of text, in any quantity, from templates. ERB templates combine plain text with Ruby code for variable substitution and flow control, making them easy to write and maintain.

4. Params: In Rails context, is a parameters method. They refer to the parameters being passed to the controller vie a GET or POST request.

5. API: stands for Application Programming Interface. Usually, an API describes a relationship between two pieces of software and their predetermined way of communicating. There are four widely agreed-upon types of web APIs: open APIs, partner APIs, internal APIs, and composite APIs.
